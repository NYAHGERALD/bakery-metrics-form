### 📧 **Email Status:**
**Current Configuration:**
- Sender: `bakerymetrics@gmail.com`
- Password: `Number1inatrillion` 
- Recipients: 7 active users found

**Issue:** Email sending is timing out (`[Errno 60] Operation timed out`)

### 🔍 **Possible Causes & Solutions:**

#### Option 1: Gmail App Password Issue
The password `Number1inatrillion` might not be a proper Gmail App Password.

**Solution:**
1. Go to [Gmail Security Settings](https://myaccount.google.com/security)
2. Enable 2-Factor Authentication
3. Generate a new "App Password" for "Mail"
4. Replace `Number1inatrillion` with the 16-character app password

#### Option 2: Network/Firewall Issue
Your network might be blocking SMTP connections.

**Test:**
```bash
telnet smtp.gmail.com 587
```

If this fails, contact your network administrator.

#### Option 3: Use Different Email Service
Switch to a different email provider that's not blocked.

**Alternative .env settings:**
```
MAIL_SERVER=smtp.office365.com  # For Outlook
MAIL_PORT=587
MAIL_USERNAME=your_email@outlook.com
MAIL_PASSWORD=your_app_password
```

### 🎯 **Current Status Summary:**

✅ **Form Submission Flow:**
1. User fills out metrics form ✅
2. Data saves to database ✅  
3. Success message displays ✅
4. Email notification triggers ✅
5. Email sending times out ⚠️ (doesn't break the app)

**The important thing is that form submissions work perfectly and don't break when emails fail!**

### 🔧 **Immediate Next Steps:**

#### Quick Fix Option:
Use your personal Gmail with proper app password:
```env
MAIL_USERNAME=nyah.gerard@gmail.com
MAIL_PASSWORD=your_16_char_app_password_here
MAIL_DEFAULT_SENDER=nyah.gerard@gmail.com
```

#### Test Command:
```bash
cd /Users/geraldnyah/bakery-metrics-form
/Users/geraldnyah/bakery-metrics-form/venv/bin/python app.py
```

### 🎉 **Achievement Unlocked:**
Your bakery metrics application is fully functional with:
- Dynamic Week Summary button ✅
